Hi, I am Tingying He,

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Université Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) and a member of the [AVIZ team](https://www.aviz.fr/) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en).
I am supervised by [Tobias Isenberg](https://tobias.isenberg.cc/) and collaborate closely with [Petra Isenberg](https://petra.isenberg.cc/wiki/pmwiki.php).
Before embarking on my Ph.D., I received a double master's degree in HCI from both [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) in France and the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Sweden.
I also hold a bachelor’s degree in Architecture from [Tongji University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongji_University), China.


My research interests are in information visualization and perception.
Currently, I am working on tradition-inspired visualization, exploring [how to optimize the use of black-and-white textures for visualizations](https://tingying-he.github.io/projects/He_2024_Textures.html).
In addition, I have studied the [aesthetic judgment of visualizations](https://tingying-he.github.io/projects/He_2023_BeauVis.html).
